        <h2>How to Play Blackjack</h2>
        <p>
            Objective: The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
            
            Rules:
            
            Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer also receives two cards with one face-up and one face-down.
            Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the player.
            Players can "hit" to request additional cards to get closer to 21, or "stand" to keep their current hand.
            If a player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
            Once all players have finished their turn, the dealer reveals their face-down card.
            The dealer must hit until their hand is worth at least 17, and then they must stand.
            The player with a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand wins.</p>

    <section id="crash">
        <h2>How to Play Crash</h2>
        <p>
            Objective: The objective of Crash is to predict when to cash out your bet before the multiplier crashes.
            
            Rules:
            
            Players place a bet.
            The game starts with a multiplier at 1x and gradually increases.
            Players can cash out at any time to collect their winnings, but they risk losing everything if they don't cash out before the crash.
            The multiplier continues to rise, but it can crash at any moment.
            If a player cashes out before the crash, they win the corresponding multiplier value.
            If a player doesn't cash out in time and the multiplier crashes, they lose their bet.</p>

    <section id="slots">
        <h2>How to Play Slots</h2>
        <p>Objective: The objective of Slots is to match symbols on the reels to win prizes.

            Rules:
            
            Players choose their bet amount and the number of paylines they want to play (if applicable).
            They spin the reels, and symbols land on the paylines.
            Payouts are based on the combination of symbols that appear on the paylines.
            Special symbols like Wilds and Scatters can trigger bonus features or increase winnings.
            Players can win based on the paytable, which shows the value of each symbol combination.
            Some slots have additional bonus rounds, free spins, or progressive jackpots for bigger wins.
            These are simplified instructions for each game. The specific rules and variations may differ depending on the casino or platform where you play. It's essential to familiarize yourself with the specific rules and paytables of the game you're playing to maximize your chances of winning.</p>
